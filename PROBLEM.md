Using the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json ) write
a simple command line application to search the data and return the results in a human
readable format. Feel free to use libraries or roll your own code as you see fit. Where the data
exists, values from any related entities should be included in the results. The user should be
able to search on any field, full value matching is fine (e.g. “mar” won’t return “mary”). The user
should also be able to search for empty values, e.g. where description is empty.
Search can get pretty complicated pretty easily, we just want to see that you can code a basic
search application.
